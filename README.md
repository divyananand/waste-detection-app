# Waste Detection App

## Overview
This project is a **Waste Detection System** I created to **learn object detection and image processing**. The goal was to experiment with YOLOv5 and OpenCV, process custom image datasets, and visualize waste detection results in real-time.

---

## Motivation
I developed this project to:  
- Explore real-time object detection using YOLOv5.  
- Learn how to preprocess, annotate, and augment datasets.  
- Understand end-to-end integration of a **Python backend** (Flask) with a **React frontend**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with deploying a simple AI-powered web application.  

---

## Features
- Upload an image and detect multiple types of waste.  
- Annotated images show detected waste with bounding boxes.  
- Returns detection results as simple text (e.g., "Glass â€” 75% confidence").  
- Minimal, responsive frontend with live preview and detection results.
